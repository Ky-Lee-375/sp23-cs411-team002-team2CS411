# Final Report

## 1. Please list out changes in the directions of your project if the final project is different from your original proposal (based on your stage 1 proposal submission).

There was so significant change in direction from what we had originally wrote from Stage 1. We modeled our current UI very closely to what we had shown in the mockup during stage 1. Rather than only getting data from the Tokyo data set, we also used another table to add an officials table but that was to make our project more comprehensive. Something we also changed (but rather upgraded) was that users could see what fun facts they inserted as well as others.

## 2. Discuss what you think your application achieved or failed to achieve regarding its usefulness.

We believe that our project is extremely useful and unique to its users. By adding a functionality that includes pictures of the athletes that played in the Tokyo Olympics, our users can not only add a fun fact to each of the athletes, but they are also able to see a picture of their athlete.

## 3. Discuss if you changed the schema or source of the data for your application

## 4. Discuss what you change to your ER diagram and/or your table implementations. What are some differences between the original design and the final design? Why? What do you think is a more suitable design? 

## 5. Discuss what functionalities you added or removed. Why?

The core functionalities remained the same: allowing users to create, update, delete.

## 6. Explain how you think your advanced database programs complement your application.

## 7. Each team member should describe one technical challenge that the team encountered.  This should be sufficiently detailed such that another future team could use this as helpful advice if they were to start a similar project or where to maintain your project. 

## 8. Are there other things that changed comparing the final application with the original proposal?

## 9. Describe future work that you think, other than the interface, that the application can improve on

## 10. Describe the final division of labor and how well you managed teamwork.
